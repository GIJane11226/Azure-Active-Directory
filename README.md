# 🔐 Secure Access with Azure Active Directory Recap 🔐

Managing identity and access securely in the cloud was a significant milestone in my cybersecurity journey.

This project centered around configuring and managing **Azure Active Directory (AD)** to bolster security within Identity and Access Management (IAM). My goal was clear: enhance protection for user accounts and ensure controlled, secure access to cloud-based applications. The depth of this hands-on experience reaffirmed my capabilities and sparked even greater interest in cloud security solutions.

I successfully implemented several key security measures within Azure AD, focusing heavily on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This strengthened my grasp of Zero Trust principles, least privilege strategies, and crucial compliance requirements such as NIST and ISO 27001.
